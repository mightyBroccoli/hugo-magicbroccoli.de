## General Data Protection Regulation ( [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) )
The day has finally come. The new [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) has become reality. With this new law every user has the right to know what data a service is storing. This post tries to clear up the situation what that means and what actually changed.

## privacy policy
The new [privacy policy](/datenschutz) describes which user data gets processed and/or stored on my servers. In addition to that the storage duration is listed in detail.

The whole purpose of storing/ processing any user data on my services:

- provide the service the user registered for
- guarantee that the server/ service operates correctly

I do _**not**_ profile, track and/ or monetize any of my users.

## terms of service
Due to the GDPR changes and users from different countries I updated and translated the [terms of service](/termsofuse).

## changes to the system
- logging
	- log lifetime decreased from 14 to 7 days
	- logs archive lifetime decreased from 14 to 7 day (*allowing me to react to error/ warning messages*)
- removal of all direct Facebook like/ share eg buttons

## TODO
- replacement of the Disqus commentary system
- better solution to prevent xmpp spam
