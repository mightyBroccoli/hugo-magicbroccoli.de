## Server Maintenance Schedule Notice

Due to the Foreshadow bug and the resulting updates to the kernel a reboot is necessary.
My host system is scheduled to reboot in the following time period:

**11.09.2018 12:00 - 14:00 CEST**

The downtime of the server is estimated to last approximately for 30 minutes. All services will automatically restart after the reboot. If services are not working right away I will try to fix them as quick as possible.<br>
I hope that this early warning will help to mitigate issues with the approaching downtime.

If there are questions and/or suggestions please contact me with the subject *foreshadow: $details*
